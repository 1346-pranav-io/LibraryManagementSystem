<t2>Project Name: Database Connection Application</t2>
Description:

<p><
This project is a simple Java-based Database Application designed to demonstrate how to connect to a relational database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The application provides a basic framework to connect to a MySQL (or any other database) instance, execute SQL queries, and retrieve data.

The project includes essential features such as:

Establishing a connection to a database using JDBC.

Executing SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation.

Error handling for common database connection issues.

User-friendly output to display query results in the console.

This application serves as a foundation for anyone looking to learn or implement database connectivity in Java, with potential for future enhancements, such as:

Implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Extending support for other types of databases like PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Oracle.

Adding a user interface to interact with the database more efficiently.

The application is designed to be simple, making it easy to understand the core concepts of JDBC and database connections in Java.
